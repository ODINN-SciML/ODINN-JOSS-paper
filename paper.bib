	abstract = {Geoscientific models are facing increasing challenges to exploit growing datasets coming from remote sensing. Universal differential equations (UDEs), aided by differentiable programming, provide a new scientific modelling paradigm enabling both complex functional inversions to potentially discover new physical laws and data assimilation from heterogeneous and sparse observations. We demonstrate an application of UDEs as a proof of concept to learn the creep component of ice flow, i.e. a nonlinear diffusivity differential equation, of a glacier evolution model. By combining a mechanistic model based on a two-dimensional shallow-ice approximation partial differential equation with an embedded neural network, i.e. a UDE, we can learn parts of an equation as nonlinear functions that then can be translated into mathematical expressions. We implemented this modelling framework as ODINN.jl, a package in the Julia programming language, providing high performance, source-to-source automatic differentiation (AD) and seamless integration with tools and global datasets from the Open Global Glacier Model in Python. We demonstrate this concept for 17 different glaciers around the world, for which we successfully recover a prescribed artificial law describing ice creep variability by solving ∼ 500 000 ordinary differential equations in parallel. Furthermore, we investigate which are the best tools in the scientific machine learning ecosystem in Julia to differentiate and optimize large nonlinear diffusivity UDEs. This study represents a proof of concept for a new modelling framework aiming at discovering empirical laws for large-scale glacier processes, such as the variability in ice creep and basal sliding for ice flow, and new hybrid surface mass balance models.},

	abstract = {In the context of science, the well-known adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" might well be "a model is worth a thousand datasets." In this manuscript we introduce the SciML software ecosystem as a tool for mixing the information of physical laws and scientific models with data-driven machine learning approaches. We describe a mathematical object, which we denote universal differential equations (UDEs), as the unifying framework connecting the ecosystem. We show how a wide variety of applications, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, can be phrased and efficiently handled through the UDE formalism and its tooling. We demonstrate the generality of the software tooling to handle stochasticity, delays, and implicit constraints. This funnels the wide variety of SciML applications into a core set of training mechanisms which are highly optimized, stabilized for stiff equations, and compatible with distributed parallelism and GPU accelerators.},

	abstract = {DiffEqFlux.jl is a library for fusing neural networks and differential equations. In this work we describe differential equations from the viewpoint of data science and discuss the complementary nature between machine learning models and differential equations. We demonstrate the ability to incorporate DifferentialEquations.jl-defined differential equation problems into a Flux-defined neural network, and vice versa. The advantages of being able to use the entire DifferentialEquations.jl suite for this purpose is demonstrated by counter examples where simple integration strategies fail, but the sophisticated integration strategies provided by the DifferentialEquations.jl library succeed. This is followed by a demonstration of delay differential equations and stochastic differential equations inside of neural networks. We show high-level functionality for defining neural ordinary differential equations (neural networks embedded into the differential equation) and describe the extra models in the Flux model zoo which includes neural stochastic differential equations. We conclude by discussing the various adjoint methods used for backpropogation of the differential equation solvers. DiffEqFlux.jl is an important contribution to the area, as it allows the full weight of the differential equation solvers developed from decades of research in the scientific computing field to be readily applied to the challenges posed by machine learning and data science.},
