	abstract = {Geoscientific models are facing increasing challenges to exploit growing datasets coming from remote sensing. Universal differential equations (UDEs), aided by differentiable programming, provide a new scientific modelling paradigm enabling both complex functional inversions to potentially discover new physical laws and data assimilation from heterogeneous and sparse observations. We demonstrate an application of UDEs as a proof of concept to learn the creep component of ice flow, i.e. a nonlinear diffusivity differential equation, of a glacier evolution model. By combining a mechanistic model based on a two-dimensional shallow-ice approximation partial differential equation with an embedded neural network, i.e. a UDE, we can learn parts of an equation as nonlinear functions that then can be translated into mathematical expressions. We implemented this modelling framework as ODINN.jl, a package in the Julia programming language, providing high performance, source-to-source automatic differentiation (AD) and seamless integration with tools and global datasets from the Open Global Glacier Model in Python. We demonstrate this concept for 17 different glaciers around the world, for which we successfully recover a prescribed artificial law describing ice creep variability by solving ∼ 500 000 ordinary differential equations in parallel. Furthermore, we investigate which are the best tools in the scientific machine learning ecosystem in Julia to differentiate and optimize large nonlinear diffusivity UDEs. This study represents a proof of concept for a new modelling framework aiming at discovering empirical laws for large-scale glacier processes, such as the variability in ice creep and basal sliding for ice flow, and new hybrid surface mass balance models.},

In this manuscript we introduce the SciML software ecosystem as a tool for mixing the information of physical laws and scientific models with data-driven machine learning approaches. We describe a mathematical object, which we denote universal differential equations (UDEs), as the unifying framework connecting the ecosystem. We show how a wide variety of applications, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, can be phrased and efficiently handled through the UDE formalism and its tooling. We demonstrate the generality of the software tooling to handle stochasticity, delays, and implicit constraints. This funnels the wide variety of SciML applications into a core set of training mechanisms which are highly optimized, stabilized for stiff equations, and compatible with distributed parallelism and GPU accelerators.},

	abstract = {The differentiable programming paradigm is a cornerstone of modern scientific computing. It refers to numerical methods for computing the gradient of a numerical model's output. Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners. We hope that this work accelerates the fusion of scientific models and data, and fosters a modern approach to scientific modelling.},

In this work we describe differential equations from the viewpoint of data science and discuss the complementary nature between machine learning models and differential equations. We demonstrate the ability to incorporate DifferentialEquations.jl-defined differential equation problems into a Flux-defined neural network, and vice versa. The advantages of being able to use the entire DifferentialEquations.jl suite for this purpose is demonstrated by counter examples where simple integration strategies fail, but the sophisticated integration strategies provided by the DifferentialEquations.jl library succeed. This is followed by a demonstration of delay differential equations and stochastic differential equations inside of neural networks. We show high-level functionality for defining neural ordinary differential equations (neural networks embedded into the differential equation) and describe the extra models in the Flux model zoo which includes neural stochastic differential equations. We conclude by discussing the various adjoint methods used for backpropogation of the differential equation solvers. DiffEqFlux.jl is an important contribution to the area, as it allows the full weight of the differential equation solvers developed from decades of research in the scientific computing field to be readily applied to the challenges posed by machine learning and data science.},

	abstract = {The W5E5 dataset was compiled to support the bias adjustment of climate input data for the impact assessments carried out in phase 3b of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3b). Version 1.0 of the W5E5 dataset covers the entire globe at 0.5° horizontal and daily temporal resolution from 1979 to 2016. Data sources of W5E5 are version 1.0 of WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA5 data (WFDE5; Weedon et al., 2014; Cucchi et al., 2020), ERA5 reanalysis data (Hersbach et al., 2019), and precipitation data from version 2.3 of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP; Adler et al., 2003). Variables (with short names and units in brackets) included in the W5E5 dataset are Near Surface Relative Humidity (hurs, \%), Near Surface Specific Humidity (huss, kg kg-1), Precipitation (pr, kg m-2 s-1), Snowfall Flux (prsn, kg m-2 s-1), Surface Air Pressure (ps, Pa), Sea Level Pressure (psl, Pa), Surface Downwelling Longwave Radiation (rlds, W m-2), Surface Downwelling Shortwave Radiation (rsds, W m-2), Near Surface Wind Speed (sfcWind, m s-1), Near-Surface Air Temperature (tas, K), Daily Maximum Near Surface Air Temperature (tasmax, K), Daily Minimum Near Surface Air Temperature (tasmin, K), Surface Altitude (orog, m), and WFDE5-ERA5 Mask (mask, 1). W5E5 is a merged dataset. It combines WFDE5 data over land with ERA5 data over the ocean. The mask used for the merge is included in the dataset. The mask is equal to 1 over land and equal to 0 over the ocean. Over land, orog is the surface altitude used for elevation corrections in WFDE5. For all other variables already included in WFDE5 (huss, prsn, ps, rlds, rsds, sfcWind, tas), W5E5 data over land are equal to the daily mean values of the corresponding hourly WFDE5 data. W5E5 hurs over land is the daily mean of hourly hurs computed from hourly WFDE5 huss, ps, and tas using the equations of Buck (1981) as described in Weedon et al. (2010). W5E5 pr over land is the daily mean of the sum of hourly WFDE5 rainfall and snowfall. Note that W5E5 pr and prsn over land are based on WFDE5 rainfall and snowfall bias-adjusted using GPCC monthly precipitation totals. W5E5 psl over land is the daily mean of hourly psl computed from hourly WFDE5 orog, ps, and tas according to psl = ps * exp((g * orog) / (r * tas)), where g is gravity, and r is the specific gas constant of dry air. Lastly, W5E5 tasmax and tasmin over land are the daily maximum and minimum, respectively, of hourly WFDE5 tas. Over the ocean, W5E5 data are based on temporally (from hourly to daily resolution) and spatially (from 0.25° to 0.5° horizontal resolution) aggregated ERA5 data. The spatial aggregation using first-order conservative remapping was always done after the temporal aggregation. For tasmax and tasmin, hourly tas values were aggregated to daily maximum and minimum values, respectively. For all other variables, hourly values were aggregated to daily mean values. Variables unavailable in ERA5 (huss, hurs, sfcWind, orog) were first derived from available variables at hourly temporal and 0.25° horizontal resolution and then aggregated like all other variables. huss and hurs were derived from Near Surface Dewpoint Temperature, ps, and tas using the equations of Buck (1981) as described in Buck (2010). sfcWind was derived from Eastward Near-Surface Wind (uas) and Northward Near-Surface Wind (vas) according to sfcWind = sqrt(uas * uas + vas * vas). orog is equal to surface geopotential divided by gravity. Lastly, pr and prsn were bias-adjusted such that monthly W5E5 precipitation totals match GPCP version 2.3 values over the ocean. Monthly rescaling factors used for this purpose were computed following the scale-selective rescaling procedure described by Balsamo et al. (2010).},

	abstract = {Abstract. By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions:  – How does the Earth system respond to forcing? – What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?  – How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Glacier evolution models based on temperature-index approaches are commonly used to assess hydrological impacts of glacier changes. However, in large-scale applications, these models lack calibration frameworks that efficiently leverage sparse high-resolution observations, limiting their ability to resolve seasonal mass changes. Machine learning approaches can potentially address this limitation by learning relationships from sparse data that are transferable in space and time, including to unmonitored glaciers. Here, we present the Mass Balance Machine (MBM), a data-driven mass balance model based on the XGBoost architecture, designed to provide accurate and high spatio-temporal resolution regional-scale reconstructions of glacier mass balance. We trained and tested MBM using a dataset of approximately 4000 seasonal and annual point mass balance measurements from 32 glaciers across heterogeneous climate settings in mainland Norway, spanning from 1962 to 2021. To assess the advantage MBM's generalisation capabilities, we compared its predictions on independent test glaciers at various spatio-temporal scales with those of regional-scale simulations from three glacier evolution models. MBM successfully predicted annual and seasonal point mass balance on the test glaciers (RMSE of 0.59\&ndash;1.00 m w.e. and bias of -0.01\&ndash;0.04 m w.e.). On seasonal mass balance, MBM outperformed the other models across spatial scales, reducing RMSE by up to 46 \% and 25 \% on glacier-wide winter and summer mass balance, respectively. Our results demonstrate the capability of machine learning models to generalise across glaciers and climatic settings from relatively sparse mass balance data, highlighting their potential for a wide range of applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Ice shelves consist of two layers, an upper layer of meteoric ice nourished by the flow from the connected inland ice and precipitation, and a lower layer of marine ice that is built by the melting and freezing processes at the ice-ocean interface and the accretion of frazil ice from the underlying ocean. The governing thermomechanical equations in the two layers are formulated as are the boundary and transition conditions that apply at the free surface, the material interface between the meteoric and the marine ice and the ice-ocean interface. The equations comprise in the bulk mass balances for the ice and the salt water (in marine ice), momentum balance and energy balance equations, and at the boundaries kinematic equations as well as jump conditions of mass, momentum and energy. The side boundary conditions involve a prescription of the mass flow along the grounding line from the inland ice and a kinematic law describing the mass loss by calving along the floating ice-shelf front. An appropriate scaling, in which the shallowness of the ice shelves is used, gives rise to the development of a perturbation scheme for the solution of the three-dimensional equations. Its lowest-order approximation – the shallow-shelf approximation (SSA) – shows the ice flow to be predominantly horizontal with a velocity field independent of depth, but strongly depth-dependent temperature and stress distributions. This zeroth order shallow-shelf approximation excludes the treatment of ice rumples, ice rises and the vicinity of the grounding line, but higher-order equations may to within second-order accuracy in the perturbation parameter accommodate for these more complicated effects. The scaling introduced finally leads to a vertical integrated system of non-linear partial integro-differential equations describing the ice flow and evolution equation for temperature and the free surfaces.},

We present global glacier projections, excluding the ice sheets, for shared socioeconomic pathways calibrated with data for each glacier. Glaciers are projected to lose 26 ± 6\% (+1.5°C) to 41 ± 11\% (+4°C) of their mass by 2100, relative to 2015, for global temperature change scenarios. This corresponds to 90 ± 26 to 154 ± 44 millimeters sea level equivalent and will cause 49 ± 9 to 83 ± 7\% of glaciers to disappear. Mass loss is linearly related to temperature increase and thus reductions in temperature increase reduce mass loss. Based on climate pledges from the Conference of the Parties (COP26), global mean temperature is projected to increase by +2.7°C, which would lead to a sea level contribution of 115 ± 40 millimeters and cause widespread deglaciation in most mid-latitude regions by 2100.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Glaciers and ice caps are experiencing strong mass losses worldwide, challenging water availability, hydropower generation, and ecosystems. Here, we perform the first-ever glacier evolution projections based on deep learning by modelling the 21st century glacier evolution in the French Alps. By the end of the century, we predict a glacier volume loss between 75 and 88\%. Deep learning captures a nonlinear response of glaciers to air temperature and precipitation, improving the representation of extreme mass balance rates compared to linear statistical and temperature-index models. Our results confirm an over-sensitivity of temperature-index models, often used by large-scale studies, to future warming. We argue that such models can be suitable for steep mountain glaciers. However, glacier projections under low-emission scenarios and the behaviour of flatter glaciers and ice caps are likely to be biased by mass balance models with linear sensitivities, introducing long-term biases in sea-level rise and water resources projections.},
